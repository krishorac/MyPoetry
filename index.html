    <h4>Let's talk about how hard it is to open up to someone about being sad for no reason.</h4>
    <h4>Let's talk about how hard it is to explain to your friends & family that you have this heavy feeling in your chest.</h4>
    <h4>Let's talk about how hard it is to understand why you are having a panic attack while just taking a walk back home.</h4>
    <h4>Let's talk about how hard it is to understand your own self and how scary it is to feel like the whole world is falling on your shoulders and you have no idea why.</h4>

    <h4>Shit dude,</h4>
    <h4>here's to all the quiet victories.</h4>
    <h4>the things that other people take for granted but are so ,so hard for you,</h4>
    <h4>the way your voice didn't shake when you ordered your drink,</h4>
    <h4>how you got out of bed after only the second time hitting snooze even though you didn't imagine anything more difficult than facing another fucking day, </h4>
    <h4>the way you smile to strangers after crying all the day in the room,</h4>
    <h4>cherish those victories & relish them, becoz they are yours and they are important.</h4>

    <h4>It's okay to do things that make you happy.</h4>
    <h4>It's okay to learn a new language despite your parents saying it's useless.</h4>
    <h4>It's okay to do things to relax and calm down even if it's not productive.</h4>
    <h4>It's not a waste of time to doodle flowers or make cookies for yourself or make pretty patterns with tape.</h4>
    <h4>sometimes it's okay to take time to close your eyes and listen to music or look up the cloud passing by,</h4>
    <h4>It's not any less worthy if you spend more time doing what makes you happy.</h4>
    <h4>destroy the idea that life has no time for simple pleasures & happy things.</h4>
